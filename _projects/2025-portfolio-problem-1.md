### Objective:
Design a mechanism that can lift a weight to the highest possible height.

### Constraints:
- 2D Design space that is 150cm long and 50cm tall.
- Bar of fixed length
- 3 pin supports, 2 of which need to be mounted to the ground.
- Linear actuator (Tolomatic RSX High Force Rod-Style Actuator).

### My Design:

In my design, the beam only has 1 degree of freedom. It is not able to translate in the x or y directions, only rotate about
one of its pins.

### Analysis (rigid bar):
I came up with a simple mechanism that uses the linear actuator to pivot the rod about one of its ends, as seen in the design image.

To determine which linear actuator to use, I took a moment balance about the pin at the end of the rod. 
From the moment balance, I determined that maximizing the length of the bar and the output froce from the actuator would lift the weight the highest.
I have inluded a screenshot of my calculations below.

### Analysis (non-rigid bar):
My previous analysis operated under the assumption that the bar was rigid. However, all materials will deform, even slightly,
when acted upon by loads.

In this section, I now analyze the bar as if it is no longer rigid. While performing the calculations, I assumed that
the loading will stay the same even as the angle changes.

To choose a cross section for the beam, I found the moment in the beam as a function of length, and integrated that twice to 
obtain a function for the deflection versus the length of the beam. Using the two pins as boundary conditions, I solved for 
the constants of integration. From here, I found the maximum deflection to be at L/sqrt3. Then, I set the function y(x)
to be less than 0.02L at that point and solved. This way, the deflection will be capped to less than 2% of the overall length. 
Solving the inequality yielded a threshold value for E, the elastic modulus,
times I, the area moment of inertia. Here, I assumed that the load, w, would be 294 kN, or the maximum force generated by the 
linear actuator.

I decided to use a rectangular cross section for the beam, and by using the relationships I derived, determined that a 
5cm x 20cm rectangular cross section would keep the deflection below 2% of the beam's length.
