For a class, we were asked to design a mechanism to maximize the height that a weight could be lifted using a rigid bar of fixed length, 3 pin supports, and a linear actuator.

I came up with a simple mechanism that uses the linear actuator to pivot the rod about one of its ends, as seen in the design image.

To determine which linear actuator to use, I took a moment balance about the pin at the end of the rod. From the moment balance, I determined that maximizing the length of the bar and the output froce from the actuator would lift the weight the highest.

This makes sense intuitively because increasing the rod length increases the moment arm. This effectively "amplifies" the force applied by the actuator about the support.
